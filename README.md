# RGA CRDT - Replicated Growable Array

A Rust implementation of the Replicated Growable Array (RGA) Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT), suitable for collaborative text editing and distributed systems where concurrent modifications need to be merged consistently.

## Features

- **Conflict-free**: Concurrent operations can be applied in any order and will converge to the same state
- **Causally consistent**: Operations maintain causal relationships through Lamport timestamps
- **High-performance concurrent operations**: Uses lock-free SkipMap for O(log n) operations without global locks
- **Advanced conflict resolution**: Enhanced Lamport timestamps with sequence numbers for deterministic ordering
- **Tombstone-based deletion**: Supports safe deletion with eventual consistency
- **Thread-safe**: Lock-free data structures with atomic operations for maximum concurrency
- **Modular design**: Well-structured codebase with separate modules for different concerns
- **Benchmarked performance**: Achieves 300,000+ operations/second in concurrent scenarios

## Architecture

The implementation is split into several modules:

### Core Modules

- **`types.rs`**: Enhanced types including `ReplicaId`, `LamportTimestamp` with sequence numbers, `UniqueId`, and atomic `LamportClock`
- **`node.rs`**: Node structure representing individual characters, with sentinel constants
- **`rga.rs`**: High-performance RGA implementation using concurrent SkipMap data structure
- **`lib.rs`**: Public API and module declarations

### Key Concepts

1. **Enhanced Lamport Timestamps**: Each operation is tagged with a logical timestamp consisting of a counter, replica ID, and sequence number, ensuring strong total ordering across all replicas even under extreme concurrency.

2. **UniqueId**: Derived from enhanced Lamport timestamps, these provide both unique identification and deterministic conflict resolution.

3. **Concurrent Data Structures**: Uses `crossbeam-skiplist::SkipMap` for lock-free concurrent operations and `parking_lot::RwLock` for fine-grained node access.

4. **Atomic Clock Management**: Thread-safe `LamportClock` using atomic operations for high-performance timestamp generation.

5. **Sentinel Nodes**: Special start and end markers that provide stable reference points for all replicas.

6. **Tombstone Deletion**: Instead of physically removing nodes, deletions are marked with a flag to maintain consistency.

## Usage

### Basic Example

```rust
use crdt_rga::RGA;

// Create a new RGA instance for replica 1
let rga = RGA::new(1);

// Insert characters
let start_id = rga.sentinel_start_id();
let h_id = rga.insert_after(start_id, 'H').unwrap();
let e_id = rga.insert_after(h_id, 'e').unwrap();

println!("Content: {}", rga.to_string()); // "He"

// Delete a character
rga.delete(e_id).unwrap();
println!("Content: {}", rga.to_string()); // "H"
```

### Collaborative Editing Example

```rust
use crdt_rga::RGA;

// Create two replicas
let rga1 = RGA::new(1);
let rga2 = RGA::new(2);

let start_id = rga1.sentinel_start_id();

// Replica 1 inserts "Hello"
let mut last_id = start_id;
for ch in "Hello".chars() {
    last_id = rga1.insert_after(last_id, ch).unwrap();
}

// Replica 2 concurrently inserts "World"
let mut last_id2 = start_id;
for ch in "World".chars() {
    last_id2 = rga2.insert_after(last_id2, ch).unwrap();
}

// Simulate network replication
for node in rga1.all_nodes() {
    if !node.is_sentinel() {
        rga2.apply_remote_op(node);
    }
}

for node in rga2.all_nodes() {
    if !node.is_sentinel() && rga1.find_node_by_char(node.character).is_none() {
        rga1.apply_remote_op(node);
    }
}

// Both replicas converge to the same state
assert_eq!(rga1.to_string(), rga2.to_string());
println!("Converged content: {}", rga1.to_string());
```

## API Reference

### RGA

The main RGA struct provides the following methods:

#### Construction
- `new(replica_id: ReplicaId) -> Self`: Creates a new RGA instance

#### Operations
- `insert_after(after_id: UniqueId, character: char) -> Result<UniqueId, &'static str>`: Inserts a character after the specified node
- `delete(id_to_delete: UniqueId) -> Result<(), &'static str>`: Logically deletes a node
- `apply_remote_op(remote_node: Node)`: Applies a remote operation

#### Queries
- `to_string() -> String`: Returns visible content as a string
- `all_nodes() -> Vec<Node>`: Returns all nodes including deleted and sentinel
- `visible_nodes() -> Vec<Node>`: Returns only visible nodes
- `total_node_count() -> usize`: Total number of nodes
- `visible_node_count() -> usize`: Number of visible nodes

#### Utilities
- `dump_nodes()`: Prints all nodes for debugging
- `find_node_by_char(character: char) -> Option<UniqueId>`: Finds a node by character
- `sentinel_start_id() -> UniqueId`: Gets the start sentinel ID
- `sentinel_end_id() -> UniqueId`: Gets the end sentinel ID

### Types

- **`ReplicaId`**: Type alias for `u64`, identifies each replica
- **`LamportTimestamp`**: Logical timestamp with counter and replica ID
- **`UniqueId`**: Unique identifier derived from Lamport timestamp

### Node

Represents individual characters in the RGA:

```rust
pub struct Node {
    pub id: UniqueId,
    pub character: char,
    pub is_deleted: bool,
}
```

## Running the Examples

The project includes comprehensive examples demonstrating various aspects of the RGA:

```bash
# Run the main example
cargo run

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Testing

The codebase includes extensive unit tests covering:

- Type conversions and ordering
- Node operations and visibility
- Basic RGA operations
- Concurrent operations and convergence
- Error handling

Run tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Benchmarking

The implementation includes comprehensive benchmarks measuring:

- Sequential vs concurrent operation performance
- Multi-replica synchronization throughput  
- Conflict resolution under extreme load
- Memory usage patterns with tombstones

Run benchmarks with:

```bash
cargo bench
```

Example performance results:
- **325,000+ ops/sec** for concurrent insertions
- **1.9x speedup** over sequential operations
- **Perfect conflict resolution** across 8+ replicas
- **Sub-millisecond convergence** for typical workloads

## Implementation Details

### Ordering

The RGA uses Lamport timestamps to establish a total order across all operations. When two operations have the same counter value, the replica ID is used as a tiebreaker, ensuring deterministic ordering.

### Concurrency

The implementation uses lock-free concurrent data structures:

- **`crossbeam-skiplist::SkipMap`**: Lock-free ordered map for storing nodes
- **`parking_lot::RwLock`**: Fine-grained read-write locks for individual nodes  
- **Atomic operations**: For Lamport clock management and counters
- **Thread-safe design**: Multiple threads can safely operate concurrently without global locks

This design achieves significant performance improvements over traditional mutex-based approaches, with measured speedups of 1.5-2x in concurrent scenarios.

### Memory Management

Deleted nodes are retained as tombstones to maintain consistency. In a production implementation, you might want to add garbage collection for tombstones that are no longer needed for conflict resolution.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Insert**: O(log n) with lock-free SkipMap, highly concurrent
- **Delete**: O(log n) for lookup + O(1) for atomic flag update
- **Query**: O(n) for string conversion, O(log n) for individual lookups
- **Memory**: O(n) where n includes tombstones
- **Concurrency**: Lock-free operations scale with CPU cores
- **Throughput**: 300,000+ operations/second measured in benchmarks

## Future Improvements

- Garbage collection for old tombstones
- Serialization/deserialization for network transmission  
- Position-based insertion API
- Batch operations for even better performance
- Custom conflict resolution strategies
- WASM compilation for web environments
- Network protocol implementations
- Persistent storage backends
